Create an inventory web app
This is the apps basic functionality

It keeps a record of items

Each item has a

name
quantity
description
image
date purchased
tags

The app will have a dashboard, search page, tags page (and eventually a login option)

The items will be sorted by category, which will be like a folder, or a project
and it will appear on the dashboard

Inside the folder there will be different items displayed there,

The item name, unit and some tags.

There will be some default tags, but you could also create tags that can be used everywhere

An item can have more than one tag

The tags on each will be a list of object ids

So the views will be

dashboard
search
tags
tags create
tags update
tags delete
folder
folder create
folder delete
folder update
item
item create
item delete
item update
